# SimpleCalculator-Kotlin.
This Kotlin code defines a simple calculator app using Android Studio. It performs basic arithmetic calculations with input validation. The layout is inflated using ActivityMainBinding, and the 'calculate' function handles logic based on the selected operator. It gracefully handles invalid input using the 'when' expression.
